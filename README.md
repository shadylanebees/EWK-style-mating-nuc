# EWK-style-mating-nuc
An EWK style mating new for 3D printer

A 3D printable mating nuc, based on the European EWK (Ein Waben Kaestchen) idea. Two or more of these nucs can be placed into a 
box - each nuc having a small amount of bees to mate a queen but the combined warmth of a larger hive. The nucs have sides that
are transparent (plexiglass), so you can view the queen, etc. without opening the nuc up.

The design uses OpenSCAD - with parametric bits, meaning it is not fully parametric at this point but it is customizable.

For example, my design allow me to use full length Langstroth medium frames (so I can take those frames out and simply place
them in any hive) - or you can shorten the length down to more like the European lengths.

I'm also trying to make this modular - so that new ideas can be easily incorporated - or you can just print the parts you 
need or desire.

DO NOTE: Working on this during the 2016/2017 winter - this HAS NOT been tried or tested as of yet.
THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL
