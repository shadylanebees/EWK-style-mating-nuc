# EWK-style-mating-nuc
A 3D printed EWK style mating nuc.

A 3D printable mating nuc, based on the European EWK (Ein Waben Kaestchen) idea.  Essentially this is a one frame nuc that can be placed into a box with 2 or more (depending on the size of the box) of these nucs to share warmth. Mating nucs have a small population of bees, so keeping themselves warm can be challenging. The nucs have sides that are transparent (Plexiglas), so you can view the queen, etc. without opening the nuc up.

Built with all 3D printed parts except for the plexiglass sides (3/32 (2.4mm) x  7 3/16 (182mm) x 19 1/16 (484 mm) and one #4 x 3/8 (3mmx8) self-tapping (sheet metal, wood, cement) pan head screw to attach the entrance disk gate.  

Tap Plastics (http://www.tapplastics.com/) can custom cut Plexiglas at about $3.50 each with reasonable shipping.

All pieces can be printed on a 3D printer that has an X and/or Y access of at least 220mm. The pieces connect without glue but glue or friction/fusion welding with a Dremmel tool or using an inexpensive 3D pen to weld the parts together helps to stiffen and toughen the whole assembly. Gluing is really only feasible with non PLA filaments (I haven't found PLA to glue well).

Designed in OpenSCAD - with parametric bits, meaning it is not fully parametric at this point but it is customizable.
For example, my design allows me to use full length Langstroth medium frames (so I can take those frames out of any nuc and simply place them in any hive) - or if you want, you can shorten the length down to any desirable length.

Grab the Public Domain dovetail code from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10269/ and place in your library folder (menu: File/Show Library Folder)

The top portion of the mating nuc has a queen excluder, so that bees can gain access to feed while keeping the queen out of it. Feed should be only solids (fondant sugar mixed with water or honey to form a dough-like substance is best).

I'm also trying to make this modular - so that new ideas can be easily incorporated - or you can just print the parts you need or desire.

ASA filament or a high temp/low warp PLA should work best. I print with 20% infill and .8 top/botom/shell.

DO NOTE: Working on this during the 2016/2017 winter - this HAS NOT been tried or tested as of yet. THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL
